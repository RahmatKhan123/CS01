// it has 18 iteration.
// it wokr such as, start print when both"i" and "j" are at zero.
//then print out 0 for i and j.
// then keeps print 0 for i until M is less i which is 4. because i is 5.
// the print 1 for i and print j until J is less then previews i which was 4, so j is print until 3.
// print 2 for i and 2 for j and loop terminate becuase j can not become less than i.
